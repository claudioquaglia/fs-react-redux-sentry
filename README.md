# Understanding React + Redux errors with Sentry and FullStory
[Sentry](https://sentry.io) is an error monitoring platform used by development teams around the world to identify when issues crop up in their applications. [FullStory](https://www.fullstory.com) lets development teams view user experience friction through the eyes of their users.

Sentry + FullStory arms development teams with an unprecedented ability to understand the details around the issues impacting their users.

## Searching Hacker News
The Search Hacker News React/Redux app example in this repo is based on [Robin Weiruch’s fantastic tutorial](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-redux-tutorial/). There are a few differences from Robin’s original example:

1. [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) are used instead of class components and lifecycle events.
2. [Redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) is used for fetching stories from Hacker News rather than redux-saga.
3. This app is (deliberately) riddled with bugs :)

You can try out the Search Hacker News app [here](http://fs-redux-sentry.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/) or you can clone this repo and `npm install` then `npm run start`. The code is built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Setting up FullStory
You’ll need a FullStory [Professional](https://www.fullstory.com/pricing/) account, though you can get a two-week free trial if you want to try out Sentry + FullStory cost-free. Once you’ve setup an account, update the `_fs_org` value in the [FullStory snippet](https://help.fullstory.com/using/recording-snippet) in [public/index.html](https://github.com/patrick-fs/fs-react-redux-sentry/blob/master/public/index.html):

```JavaScript
window['_fs_org'] = 'your org id here';
```

### Setting up Sentry
Sentry should be initialized as soon as possible during your application load up. In Search Hacker News, `Sentry.init` is called before the `App` component is loaded in [src/index.js](https://github.com/patrick-fs/fs-react-redux-sentry/blob/master/src/index.js).

```JSX
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';

Sentry.init({ dsn: 'https://<your key>@sentry.io/<your project>' });

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

```
Once you are logged into Sentry, go [here](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/react/) to find your `Sentry.init` statement (prefilled with your key and project values).

## How FullStory links with Sentry
FullStory’s [`FS.getCurrentSessionURL`](https://help.fullstory.com/develop-js/getcurrentsessionurl) API function retrieves a session replay URL for a particular moment in time. These URLs are deep links that can be shared with other tools and services. Session URLs are embedded into Sentry events using [Sentry scopes](https://docs.sentry.io/enriching-error-data/scopes/). When you put it all together it [looks like this](https://github.com/patrick-fs/fs-react-redux-sentry/blob/master/src/api/error.js):

```JSX
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';
import * as FullStory from './fullstory';

const recordError = (error, extraInfo = null) => {
  Sentry.withScope(scope => {
    if (extraInfo) {
      scope.setExtras(extraInfo);
    }
    scope.setExtra('fullstory', FullStory.getCurrentSessionURL(true));
    error.sentryEventId = Sentry.captureException(error);
  });

  FullStory.event('Application error', {
    name: error.name,
    message: error.message,
    fileName: error.fileName,
    lineNumber: error.lineNumber,
    stack: error.stack,
    sentryEventId: error.sentryEventId,
  });
}

export default recordError;
```

We’re also using the FullStory [custom events API](https://help.fullstory.com/develop-js/363565-fs-event-api-sending-custom-event-data-into-fullstory) to search in FullStory for users and sessions that experienced errors on the Search Hacker News app.

## All the things that can go wrong...

### Handling and reviewing errors in React components
React 16 introduced [Error Boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) to handle exceptions thrown while rendering components.

There's a single error boundary in Search Hacker News surrounding the [`App`](https://github.com/patrick-fs/fs-react-redux-sentry/blob/master/src/components/App.js) component declaration:

```JSX
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import SearchStories from './SearchStories';
import Stories from './Stories';
import ErrorToast from './ErrorToast';
import ErrorBoundary from './ErrorBoundry';

const App = () => (
  <div className="app">
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <ErrorToast></ErrorToast>
      <div className="interactions">
        <SearchStories />
      </div>
      <Stories />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

If you search for “Florida” an error is thrown from the [SearchStories](https://github.com/patrick-fs/fs-react-redux-sentry/blob/master/src/components/SearchStories.js) component (a poke at my home state).

[Sentry screen grab of error]

A FullStory session replay URL is included in the Sentry issue that deep links to the moment the issue was created.

Clicking on this link allows you to see the user’s actions leading up to and following the error.
